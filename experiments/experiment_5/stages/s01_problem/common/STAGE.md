# s01_problem / common - Problem statement

Spec: `spec/pipeline_design.md` -> s01. Teacher/TA rows: `spec/sources.md` (search `S01`).
Blueprint: `spec/blueprints/s01_problem.md` (implement only when its status is AGREED).

**Gate question:** Are tasks, targets, metrics, cost, decision rule and budget fixed before any result?

## Purpose
Fix both checkout tasks, prediction time, stakeholders and their actions, targets and label rules, metrics, the illustrative FN:FP = 5:1 cost, model families, decision rule, grids, budget, seed 42 and the test cutoff (protocol layer a: pre-registered) - before any data is seen.

## Planned outputs (`outputs/`)
- spec/protocol.yaml v1.0 (proposed via CHANGELOG)
- task_contract.md (prediction time, stakeholder action, limits, metric and model rationale with verified citations)

## Gate criteria
- Every number later stages need is in protocol.yaml
- Decision rule and tie-breaks written before any result
- Stakeholder action stated, not only named
- Every citation verified to exist and support its claim
- protocol.yaml separates pre-registered values from data-dependent values owned by s04 and s05

## Review summary (owner fills at gate; cite files, never type numbers from memory)
- What was done:
- Decision and rule applied (`outputs/decision.json`):
- Key evidence (file -> what it shows):
- Limitations:

## Gate check (reviewer)
- [ ] Every gate criterion above is met (note any exception)
- [ ] `run_pipeline.py run --node` reproduces all outputs from a clean tree
- [ ] Standard output shapes and `_manifest.json` present (README section 5.5)

## Deviations from spec
None.
